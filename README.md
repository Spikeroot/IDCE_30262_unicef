# IDCE 30262 Final Project
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how web mapping tools can support UNICEF's work and strengthen decision-making practices. This repository contains a mock HTML site for UNICEF hosting several web mapping products; these products address topics important to the organization's services and mission and are intended for various audiences and phases of the project cycle. The project page can be accessed [here.](https://spikeroot.github.io/IDCE_30262_unicef/index.html)

## Education
Kenya has made significant progress in increasing the accessibility of education, but there are still significant inequities in access, particularly among marginalized groups in nomadic and informal urban communities.

Several web mapping products were used within this project to display the dynamics of these inequities. The first is an ArcGIS Online (AGOL) dashboard created by Zoe Maymon. This dashboard presents a nuanced explanation of the distribution of both education access and overcrowding within classrooms, ideal for directing efforts during early decision-making phases. This would likely be an internal-facing map.


## Healthcare
Kenya has made strides in reducing childhood mortality, but significant issues of healthcare access still exist.
The healthcare workforce is small and poorly distributed throughout the country, making it difficult for many to access services.

The map used in this project, created by Qi Zhang using Mapbox GL JS, displays both point locations of healthcare facilities within Kenya as well as a heatmap showing density of such facilities across the country. Using the slider, the data can be displayed side-by-side.

## Details and Attributions
