# IDCE 30262 Final Project
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how web mapping tools can support UNICEF's work and strengthen decision-making practices. This repository contains a mock HTML site for UNICEF hosting several web mapping products; these products address topics important to the organization's services and mission and are intended for various audiences and phases of the project cycle.
