  <h3 style= 'width=100%'><small>In Kenya, overcrowded schools are a major problem and have been for over a decade. Overcrowded schools were a result of policies passed back in 2003 to combat the lack of students attending primary schools that they can’t afford (<a href="https://theconversation.com/some-kenyan-schools-are-dangerously-overcrowded-what-must-be-done-131774">Charles et. Al. 2015</a>). As a result of this legislation, “enrollment in government primary schools increased by almost 1.3 million students in 2003, from 6 million in 2002 to 7.3 million in 2003”. (<a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/news/education/Overcrowding-woes-as-schools-reopen/2643604-5415790-3pp9toz/index.html">Maurice Mutisya, 2020</a>). Statistical papers, such as one published by the Republic of Kenya by 2016, state that counties like Turkana has on average 92 learners per teacher, while Mandera had 80 and Garissa had 67 (<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1080614.pdf">Rep. Of Kenya, 2016</a>). <br>

    The dashboard below displays a combination of datasets: total population, total amount of schools, and total amount of overloaded desks (number of desks in overloaded classrooms) for each county in Kenya. This dashboard displays these datasets as they all factors in showing how densely populated each county is, how many schools there are, and how crowded those schools are. </small></h3>

  <h3 style= 'width=100%'><small>This first swipe map shows the comparison between the population with basic education and the
     population under 18 years old in Kenya and the second one shows the comparison between the highly educated population
     and the educated population, By dragging the slide bar, you can explore the comparative map or click on a county to observe
      the population in the county with different levels of education, the data is from two humdata (2019) data sets, we can find
       that the basic education in Kenya is developing well, but the popularity of higher education is still at a low level.</small></h3>
